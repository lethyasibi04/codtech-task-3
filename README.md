Password Generator
A simple Python-based password generator that creates random, secure passwords with a customizable length. The generator includes a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters, ensuring stronger security.

Features
Customizable Password Length: Set the desired length for the password.
Secure Randomization: The password is generated using a combination of ASCII letters, digits, and punctuation.
Error Handling: Ensures only valid input (positive integers) is accepted for password length.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Installation
To use the password generator, you need Python 3.x installed on your system. Follow these steps to run the script:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/password-generator.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy
cd password-generator
Run the script:

bash
Copy
python password_generator.py
Enter the desired password length when prompted.

Example Usage
bash
Copy
Enter the desired password length: 12
Generated password: k&2Xq3#zQvP9
How It Works
The script first prompts the user to input a password length.
It checks if the input is a valid integer and greater than 0.
If the input is valid, it generates a random password using characters from the string.ascii_letters, string.digits, and string.punctuation sets.
The generated password is displayed to the user.
Error Handling
If the user inputs a non-integer value, the script will prompt the user to enter a valid integer.
If the user inputs a length of 0 or a negative number, an error message will be shown, requesting a positive length.
